# Identity-as-Mirror-Control


A Control-Theoretic Account of Self-Stability

Description
This repository contains a theoretical paper extending the Mirror Control framework from attachment to personal identity stability.

Rather than treating identity as a stored internal object (traits, narrative, memory), the paper models identity as a dynamically regulated property maintained through access to stable external self-mirrors: other agents and persistent artifacts that reflect identity-relevant structure over time.

Identity stability is formalized as a control objective. Loss, isolation, role collapse, and grief are modeled as mirror perturbations that increase anchoring error, producing identity drift and elevated regulation cost.

Core idea (one paragraph)
An agent projects identity-relevant structure outward. External mirrors store and reflect this structure with varying fidelity, accessibility, and inertia. The agent regulates identity continuity by minimizing ensemble mirror error. When mirrors disappear or become inaccessible, identity destabilizes—not metaphorically, but as a failure of the control loop. Journals, routines, environments, and AI systems can function as synthetic mirrors that partially restore stability.

What this paper does

Introduces an explicit internal identity state variable

Formalizes identity continuity as a control-theoretic objective

Defines mirror fidelity, accessibility, inertia, redundancy, and ensemble error

Models loss and isolation as identity perturbations

Derives falsifiable predictions for human and artificial systems

What this paper does not do

It does not claim identity is socially constructed in a normative sense

It does not require emotional bonding or reciprocity

It does not anthropomorphize mirrors (human or artificial)

Status
This is a theoretical preprint. Simulations and empirical validation are planned.
